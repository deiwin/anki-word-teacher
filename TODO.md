 - Instead of the saved_words.yaml file, get the already imported words from Anki
 - Add ignored words
 - Add a way to manually change definitions
 - Remove highlights from kindle if imported (use the newer(other) github repo and improve it)
 - Handle no new words case
 - Write tests (use rspec)
 - Use a Logger for logging instead of a lambda
 - Offer an option to select books for which to download highlights on the MMI
  - Every time a new book is added to Amazon, ask if definitions should be fetched for that book as well
